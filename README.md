Faraday is an HTTP client library abstraction layer that provides a common interface over many
adapters (such as Net::HTTP) and embraces the concept of Rack middleware when processing the request/response cycle.
Take a look at [Awesome Faraday][awesome] for a list of available adapters and middleware.

## Why use Faraday?

Faraday gives you the power of Rack middleware for manipulating HTTP requests and responses,
making it easier to build sophisticated API clients or web service libraries that abstract away
the details of how HTTP requests are made.

Faraday comes with a lot of features out of the box, such as:
* Support for multiple adapters (Net::HTTP, Typhoeus, Patron, Excon, HTTPClient, and more)
* Persistent connections (keep-alive)
* Parallel requests
* Automatic response parsing (JSON, XML, YAML)
* Customization of the request/response cycle with middleware
* Support for streaming responses
* Support for uploading files
* And much more!

## Getting Started

The best starting point is the [Faraday Website][website], with its introduction and explanation.

Need more details? See the [Faraday API Documentation][apidoc] to see how it works internally, or take a look at [Advanced techniques for calling HTTP APIs in Ruby](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/advanced-http-techniques-in-ruby) blog post from [@mattbrictson](https://github.com/mattbrictson) ðŸš€

## Supported Ruby versions

This library aims to support and is [tested against][actions] the currently officially supported Ruby
implementations. This means that, even without a major release, we could add or drop support for Ruby versions,
following their [EOL](https://endoflife.date/ruby).
Currently that means we support Ruby 3.0+

If something doesn't work on one of these Ruby versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations and versions, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely
fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time
of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
