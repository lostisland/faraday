# Faraday Website

This is the root directory of the [Faraday Website][website].
If you want to apply changes to it, please test it locally using `Jekyll`.

```bash
# Navigate into the /docs folder
$ cd docs

# Install Jekyll dependencies, this bundle is different from Faraday's one.
$ bundle install

# Run the Jekyll server with the Faraday website
$ bundle exec jekyll serve

# The site will now be reachable at http://127.0.0.1:4000/faraday/
```
