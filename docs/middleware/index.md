Under the hood, Faraday uses a Rack-inspired middleware stack for making
requests. Much of Faraday's power is unlocked with custom middleware. Some
middleware is included with Faraday, and others are in external gems.

Here are some of the features that middleware can provide:

- authentication
- caching responses on disk or in memory
- cookies
- following redirects
- JSON encoding/decoding
- logging
- retrying

To use these great features, create a `Faraday::Connection` with `Faraday.new`
and add the correct middleware in a block. For example:

```ruby
require 'faraday'
require 'faraday/net_http'
require 'faraday/retry'

conn = Faraday.new do |f|
  f.request :json # encode req bodies as JSON
  f.request :retry # retry transient failures
  f.response :json # decode response bodies as JSON
  f.adapter :net_http # Use the Net::HTTP adapter
end
response = conn.get("http://httpbingo.org/get")
```

### How it Works

A `Faraday::Connection` uses a `Faraday::RackBuilder` to assemble a
Rack-inspired middleware stack for making HTTP requests. Each middleware runs
and passes an Env object around to the next one. After the final middleware has
run, Faraday will return a `Faraday::Response` to the end user.

The order in which middleware is stacked is important. Like with Rack, the first
middleware on the list wraps all others, while the last middleware is the
innermost one. If you want to use a custom [adapter](../adapters), it must
therefore be last.

### Using Middleware

Calling `use` is the most basic way to add middleware to your stack, but most
middleware is conveniently registered in the `request`, `response` or `adapter`
namespaces. All four methods are equivalent apart from the namespacing.

For example, the `Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded` middleware registers itself in
`Faraday::Request` so it can be added with `request`. These two are equivalent:

```ruby
# add by symbol, lookup from Faraday::Request,
# Faraday::Response and Faraday::Adapter registries
conn = Faraday.new do |f|
  f.request :url_encoded
  f.response :logger
  f.adapter :httpclient
end
```

or:

```ruby
# identical, but add the class directly instead of using lookups
conn = Faraday.new do |f|
  f.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  f.use Faraday::Response::Logger
  f.use Faraday::Adapter::HTTPClient
end
```

This is also the place to pass options. For example:

```ruby
conn = Faraday.new do |f|
  f.request :logger, bodies: true
end
```

### Available Middleware

The [Awesome Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/awesome-faraday/) project
has a complete list of useful, well-maintained Faraday middleware. Middleware is
often provided by external gems, like the
[faraday-retry](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-retry) gem.

We also have [great documentation](list) for the middleware that ships with
Faraday.

### Detailed Example

Here's a more realistic example:

```ruby
Faraday.new(...) do |conn|
  # POST/PUT params encoder
  conn.request :url_encoded

  # Logging of requests/responses
  conn.response :logger

  # Last middleware must be the adapter
  conn.adapter :typhoeus
end
```

This request middleware setup affects POST/PUT requests in the following way:

1. `Request::UrlEncoded` encodes as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" if not
  already encoded or of another type.
2. `Response::Logger' logs request and response headers, can be configured to log bodies as well.

Swapping middleware means giving the other priority. Specifying the
"Content-Type" for the request is explicitly stating which middleware should
process it.
