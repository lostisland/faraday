## Faraday 2.0

### Adapters have moved!

With this release, we've officially moved all adapters, except for the `net_http` one, out of Faraday.
What that means, is that they won't be available out-of-the-box anymore,
and you'll instead need to add them to your Gemfile.

**NOTE: the `net_http` adapter was originally removed as well in version `2.0`, but quickly reintroduced in version `2.0.1`.
We strongly suggest you to skip version `2.0` and instead use version `2.0.1` or greater.**

#### Why was this decision made?

We've taken this decision for the following technical reasons:

* We wanted the Faraday gem to focus on providing a clean, standardized, middleware-stack-based API.
* We wanted to free the core team from maintaining all the different adapters, relying more on the community to
  maintain them based on the broad interest. This will allow the core team to focus on implementing features
  focused on the Faraday API more quickly, without having to push it on all adapters immediately.
* With the community creating more and more adapters, we wanted to avoid having first and second-class adapters
  by having some of them included with the gem and others available externally.
* Moving adapters into separate gems allow to solve the dependency issues once and for all.
  Faraday will remain a dependency-free gem, while adapter gems will be able to automatically pull
  any necessary dependency, without having to rely on the developer to do so.

#### So what will this mean for me?

We did our best to make this transition as painless as possible for you, so here is what we did.

* All adapters, except for the `net_http` one, have already been moved out and released as separate gems.
  They've then been re-added into Faraday's v1 dependencies so that you wouldn't notice.
  This means that immediately after v2.0 will be released, all the adapters that were previously available will be
  already compatible with Faraday 2.0!
* We've setup an [Awesome Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/awesome-faraday) repository, where you can find and discover adapters.
  We also highlighted their unique features and level of compliance with Faraday's features.

#### That's great! What should I change in my code immediately after upgrading?

* If you just use the default `net_http` adapter, then you don't need to do anything!
* Otherwise, add the corresponding adapter gem to your Gemfile (e.g. `faraday-net_http_persistent`). Then, simply require them after you require `faraday`.
  ```ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem 'faraday'
  gem 'faraday-net_http_persistent'

  # Code
  require 'faraday'
  require 'faraday/net_http_persistent'
  ```

### Faraday Middleware Deprecation

In case you never used it, [Faraday Middleware](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday_middleware) is a handy collection of middleware that have so far been maintained by the Faraday core team.
With Faraday 2.0 focusing on becoming an ecosystem, rather than an out-of-the-box solution, it only made sense to take the same approach for middleware as we did for adapters. For this reason, `faraday_middleware` will not be updated to support Faraday 2.0.
Instead, we'll support the transition from centralised-repo collection of middleware to individual middleware gems, effectively replicating what we did with adapters. Each middleware will have its own repository and gem, and it will allow developers to only add the ones they require to their Gemfile.

So don't fret yet! We're doing our best to support our `faraday_middleware` users out there, so here are the steps we've taken to make this work:
* We've promoted the highly popular JSON middleware (both request encoding and response parsing) to a core middleware and it will now be shipped together with Faraday. We expect many `faraday_middleware` users will be able to just stop using the extra dependency thanks to this.
* We've created a [faraday-middleware-template](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-middleware-template) repository that will make creating a new middleware gem simple and straightforward.
* We've added a middleware section to the [awesome-faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/awesome-faraday) repo, so you can easily find available middleware when you need it.

It will obviously take time for some of the middleware in `faraday_middleware` to make its way into a separate gem, so we appreciate this might be an upgrade obstacle for some. However this is part of an effort to focus the core team resources tackling the most requested features.
We'll be listening to the community and prioritize middleware that are most used, and will be welcoming contributors who want to become owners of the middleware when these become separate from the `faraday_middleware` repo.

### Bundled middleware moved out

Moving middleware into its own gem makes sense not only for `faraday_middleware`, but also for middleware bundled with Faraday.
As of v2.0, the `retry` and `multipart` middleware have been moved to separate `faraday-retry` and `faraday-multipart` gems.
These have been identified as good candidates due to their complexity and external dependencies.
Thanks to this change, we were able to make Faraday 2.0 completely dependency free ðŸŽ‰ (the only exception being `ruby2_keywords`, which will be necessary only while we keep supporting Ruby 2.6).

#### So what should I do if I currently use the `retry` or `multipart` middleware?

Upgrading is pretty simple, because the middleware was simply moved out to external gems.
All you need to do is to add them to your gemfile (either `faraday-retry` or `faraday-multipart` and require them before usage:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'faraday-multipart'
gem 'faraday-retry'

# Connection initializer
require 'faraday/retry'
require 'faraday/multipart'

conn = Faraday.new(url) do |f|
  f.request :multipart
  f.request :retry
  # ...
end
```

### Autoloading and dependencies

Faraday has until now provided and relied on a complex dynamic dependencies system.
This would allow to reference classes and require dependencies only when needed (e.g. when running the first request) based
on the middleware/adapters used.
As part of Faraday v2.0, we've removed all external dependencies, which means we don't really need this anymore.
This change should not affect you directly, but if you're registering middleware then be aware of the new syntax:

```ruby
# `name` here can be anything you want.
# `klass` is your custom middleware class.
# This method can also be called on `Faraday::Adapter`, `Faraday::Request` and `Faraday::Response`
Faraday::Middleware.register_middleware(name: klass)
```

The `register_middleware` method also previously allowed to provide a symbol, string, proc, or array
but this has been removed from the v2.0 release to simplify the interface.
(EDIT: symbol/string/proc have subsequently been reintroduced in v2.2, but not the array).

### Authentication helper methods in Connection have been removed

You were previously able to call `authorization`, `basic_auth` and `token_auth` against the `Connection` object, but this helper methods have now been dropped.
Instead, you should be using the equivalent middleware, as explained in [this page](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/middleware/included/authentication).

For more details, see https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/pull/1306

### The `dependency` method in middlewares has been removed

In Faraday 1, a deferred require was used with the `dependency` method.

In Faraday 2, that method has been removed. In your middleware gems, use a regular `require` at the top of the file, 

### Others

* Rename `Faraday::Request#method` to `#http_method`.
* Remove `Faraday::Response::Middleware`. You can now use the new `on_complete` callback provided by `Faraday::Middleware`.
* `Faraday.default_connection_options` will now be deep-merged into new connections to avoid overriding them (e.g. headers).
* `Faraday::Builder#build` method is not exposed through `Faraday::Connection` anymore and does not reset the handlers if called multiple times. This method should be used internally only.

## Faraday 1.0

### Errors
* Removes sub-class constants definition from `Faraday::Error`. A sub-class (e.g. `ClientError`) was previously accessible
either through the `Faraday` module (e.g. `Faraday::ClientError`) or through the `Faraday::Error` class (e.g. `Faraday::Error::ClientError`).
The latter is no longer available and the former should be used instead, so check your `rescue`s.
* Introduces a new `Faraday::ServerError` (5xx status codes) alongside the existing `Faraday::ClientError` (4xx status codes).
Please note `Faraday::ClientError` was previously used for both.
* Introduces new Errors that describe the most common REST status codes:
  * Faraday::BadRequestError (400)
  * Faraday::UnauthorizedError (401)
  * Faraday::ForbiddenError (403)
  * Faraday::ProxyAuthError (407). Please note this raised a `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` before.
  * Faraday::ConflictError (409)
  * Faraday::UnprocessableEntityError (422)
* The following error classes have changed the hierarchy to better mirror their real-world usage and semantic meaning:
  * TimeoutError < ServerError (was < ClientError)
  * ConnectionFailed < Error (was < ClientError)
  * SSLError < Error (was < ClientError)
  * ParsingError < Error (was < ClientError)
  * RetriableResponse < Error (was < ClientError)

### Custom adapters
If you have written a custom adapter, please be aware that `env.body` is now an alias to the two new properties `request_body` and `response_body`.
This should work without you noticing if your adapter inherits from `Faraday::Adapter` and calls `save_response`, but if it doesn't, then please ensure you set the `status` BEFORE the `body` while processing the response.

### Others
* Dropped support for jruby and Rubinius.
* Officially supports Ruby 2.4+
* In order to specify the adapter you now MUST use the `#adapter` method on the connection builder. If you don't do so and your adapter inherits from `Faraday::Adapter` then Faraday will raise an exception. Otherwise, Faraday will automatically push the default adapter at the end of the stack causing your request to be executed twice.
```ruby
class OfficialAdapter < Faraday::Adapter
  ...
end

class MyAdapter
  ...
end

# This will raise an exception
conn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|
  f.use OfficialAdapter
end

# This will cause Faraday inserting the default adapter at the end of the stack
conn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|
  f.use MyAdapter
end

# You MUST use `adapter` method
conn = Faraday.new(...) do |f|
  f.adapter AnyAdapter
end
```
